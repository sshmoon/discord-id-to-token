# Discord ID To Token <3
**DISCLAMER: (ONLY FIRST HALF OF THE TOKEN)**


A Discord token is comprised of 3 things, the first part of your discord token is your discord id converted to Base64, so all you need to do is take the discord id and encode it in base64 and you get the first half of someones token. You can use this for trolling etc
